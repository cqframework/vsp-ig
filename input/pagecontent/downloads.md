### Full Implementation Guide
{: #full-ig}

The following file contains the complete, downloadable implementation guide:

-  [Full IG](full-ig.zip)

### IG Package
{: #package}

The following file is the FHIR IG Package [NPM Subset](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/NPM+Package+Specification)

- [package.tgz](package.tgz)

This file should be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since they contain all of the
rules about what makes these Quality Measure profiles valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the
specification and profiles that apply in order to make a conformant implementation. See the overview on
[validating FHIR profiles and resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/validation.html) for more information about validating
profiles and how to use these artifacts.

### Examples
{: #examples}

Examples used in this Implementation Guide are available in the above package.

In addition, testing artifacts are available in the form of test bundles, one for each questionnaire in the IG repository: [Test Bundles](https://github.com/HL7/us-cql-ig/tree/main/bundles/questionnaire)
