This implementation guide provides documentation and demonstration artifacts for Value Set Packages to enable IG/Publication implementers to obtain stable expansions of value sets used in IGs/Publications. The project will enable IG/Publication authors to define "Value Set Packages" for implementation guides that identify code system versions to be used to expand value sets used in the implementation guide. IG/Publication implementers will then be able to easily obtain Value Set Packages based on those definitions containing "refreshed" value sets expanded with the specified code system versions. This capability will be made available through an easy to use web-accessible interface to allow authors and implementers to define and distribute updated terminology on a predictable basis.

The project will be delivered by modifying the Value Set Manager, an existing open source implementation of Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure (CRMI) that is being used to manage public health triggering value sets, as well as FHIR-based quality measure value sets.
